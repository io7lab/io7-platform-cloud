    <p>Internet of Things are coming everywhere. And while there is no clear definition of the IoT, there are some
        chracteristics that agreeably define the Internet of Things. </p>
    <p>The IoT is backed by many modern technologies, and the distinctive three characteristics could be</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Electroniy Everything</li>
        <li>Network Everything</li>
        <li>Cloud Intelligence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And these three factors can be explained as follows</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Things are electronified easily and affordably due to the electronics technology advancement</li>
        <li>Networking things is easy and affordable due to the wireless communication technologies</li>
        <li>Computing and Automation Service is easy and flexible due to the IT technology advancement such as Cloud
            computing</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And to support this, the following is the IT architecture.</p>

    <p>Things are connected to the IoT Device Platform. They are not aware of the others and don't talk to each other
        directly but talk to the IoT Device platform. That way, mix and match are easily done by the IoT application
        level on the Cloud, ie on the IoT Application Platform.</p>

    <p>This picture shows the basic components of the io7 Internet of Things Architecture.</p>
